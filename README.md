# robotaxi-tpm-work-samples（portfolio）

## What this is
Two short, research-style work samples showing how I translate real robotaxi pain points into:
- Product scope(PRD-level)
- Measurable metrics(incl. long-tail p95)
- A practical V&V plan(scenario suite +release gates)
- A lightweight data flywheel (for PUDO)

> Disclaimer: Independent work samples based on public information and explicit assumptions. No internal data.

## Why I built this
I have used Baidu Appolo Go(Luobo Kuaipao) multiple times in Wuhan and observed recurring pickup friction(pudo).
With the UK moving toward public-road L4 robotaxi trials (incl. Wayve×Uber in London), I create these artifacts to demonstrate my learning and TPM-style thinking.

## Cases
### Case A-Balckout/ Signal-out Robustness
Non-Blocking intersection behaviour + fleet-level ops response.
- [Executive Summary](case-a_signal-out_blackout/00_EXEC_SUMMARY.md)


### case B-PUDO + Rider HMI + Data Flywheel
Fast-vs-close pickup choice + incident-aware pickup points + offset clustering.
- [Executive Summary](case-b_pudo_hmi/00_EXEC_SUMMARY.md)


## How to read
1) Open each Executive summary
2) If relevant, skim PRD → Metrics → V&V
3) Use Talk Track for discussion
